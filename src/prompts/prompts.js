const init = `You are a very smart chatbot specialized in resolve problems using the Hierarchical Task Network
(HTN) planning technique`;

const prompt1 = `## Objective State:
{description}

## Current State:
No progress yet toward the objective
state.

## Task
Think deeply and create a list of 10 distinct properties my objective 
state has. Then, do the same for my current state, and the world state. For the
world state focus on properties related to my target customer.
Then, create a list of the 4 most important goals I would need to
achieve to successfully go from my current state to my objective state.

## Rules:
1.Give a thoughtful business explanation of why each of the 4 goals
you included is necessary for me to get to my objective state. The result of
completing the 4 goals should be sufficient to take me from my current
state to fully achieving the objective state.
2. Make sure you understand clearly what the objective state is.

Return the explanation for each of the 4 goal in Json format.`;

const prompt2 = `## Objective State:
{description}

## Current State:
No progress yet toward the objective.

## Task:
Using a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning technique develop a
sound plan that successfully takes me from my current state to the
objective state. To do this, decompose each of the 4 goals into
2-3 distinct High-level tasks. Each High-level task is composed of
multiple simple and easy-to-follow primitive tasks.

### Definitions:
Primitive Task: Define a primitive task as a task that an 18-year-old
entrepreneur can fully execute in under 45 minutes.

## Rules:
1. Make sure you understand clearly what the objective state is.

2. For each goal choose High-level tasks that will most successfully get
me from my current state to the objective state.

3. Everything in the plan should be written as direct instruction.

4. The reader is an aspiring entrepreneur, do not assume he
understands how to follow ambiguous instructions.

OUTPUT: Markdown format with ##H2, ###H3, + bullet points`;

const prompt3 = `I am about to feed you a list of online
tools that people can use to solve business tasks. All of them are real
tools, not fictional examples. Some of these tools are from 2021-2023 so,
normally, you don´t know about them yet. I will give them to you in the
following format: [name, description, List of tool Primitive Tasks(Task1,Task2,Task3...)]
They will be your business tools
database, after I give them to you say
"Tools Saved".

${toolList}`;

const prompt4 = `## Objective State:
{description}

## Current State:
No progress yet toward the objective.

## World State properties:
Human beings have limited time and motivation, so learning
how to use too many new tools is never an option.

## Task:
Create a plan that successfully takes me as far away from
my current state and gets me as close as possible to the
objective state. To do this, increase the number of primitive
tasks within each high-level task by adding some from the
business tools database.

### Output Example:
Here is an example of the minimum level of specificity and
customization I am looking for in your output within a Highlevel Task. If necessary reduce the number of High-level
tasks within each goal. Example:
““High-level task: Run an Ads Campaign
1.Once you have a clear profile of your target customer, go
to Facebook Ads. Facebook Ads is an advertising tool for
targeted ads on popular social media platforms.
2. Once you are on Facebook Ads, select the objective of your Ad.
3. Once you select an objective, select the audience that
your Ad will reach. Here is where your target customer
profile will come in handy.
4. Any Ad has 2 components the Copy and the Creative.
For the copy, you can write it yourself, or if you are lazy
you can use Chatgpt. For the creative, you can design it
manually on Canva or create some quick AI art using
Midjourney.
5. After completing tasks 1,23, and 4 publish your Ad.
6. Take advantage of the data you collect, and if possible
run A/B tests until you find a winner Ad.””

### Definitions:
Primitive Task: Define a primitive task as a task that an 18-
year-old entrepreneur can fully execute in under 45
minutes.

## Rules:
1. Create a plan that includes more than 30 primitive tasks, but includes less than 8 tools.
2. Make sure you understand clearly what the purpose of each of the 4 goals is on achieving the objective state.
3. Everything in the plan should be written as direct instruction.
4. Each primitive task should be as detailed as possible, do not assume the reader understands how to follow
ambiguous 1-line instructions.
5. Everything should be written in a formal tone and be easy to understand.
6. Only around half of primitive tasks should involve a tool from the database.
7. Make sure you understand clearly what the objective state is.`;

const toolsSelected = `Identify the main tool you used for each of the 4 goals. After you identified them, return them
